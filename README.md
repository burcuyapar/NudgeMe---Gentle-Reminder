**🎯 Portfolio Project | 📱 Live on TestFlight | 🔒 Enterprise-Grade Security**

---

## 📖 Overview

NudgeMe is a production-ready iOS application that serves as a "second brain" for busy parents. Instead of manually entering reminders, parents simply speak naturally about their day, and AI handles the complexity of parsing, scheduling, and delivering context-aware notifications.

**This project demonstrates:**
- 📱 Full-stack mobile development from concept to production
- 🤖 Multi-AI integration (Claude, OpenAI Whisper, GPT-4, TTS)
- 🔐 Security-first architecture with Row Level Security
- 🎯 Complex notification systems with context-aware timing
- 🎤 Voice-first UX design and implementation
- 🚀 Professional deployment pipeline via TestFlight
- 🐛 Production debugging and critical bug fixes

---

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack

```
Frontend:          React Native 0.75.4 + Expo SDK 54
Backend:           Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + RLS)
AI Services:       Claude Haiku 3.5, OpenAI (Whisper, GPT-4o-mini, TTS-1-HD)
Notifications:     Expo Notifications API (local scheduling)
Navigation:        React Navigation 7
State Management:  React Hooks + AsyncStorage
Voice Processing:  expo-av for audio recording
```

### Database Schema

```sql
users
├── id (UUID, primary key - not used for relationships)
├── user_id (TEXT, stores auth.users.id) ← Foreign key reference
├── name, email
└── timestamps

children
├── id (UUID, primary key)
├── user_id (TEXT, references users.user_id) ← Critical relationship
├── name, age, school_status
└── timestamps

reminders
├── id (UUID, primary key)
├── user_id (TEXT, references users.user_id) ← RLS filtering
├── child_id (UUID, references children.id)
├── category (school, activity, personal, household)
├── title, notes
├── event_time (Display time for users)
├── notification_time (Actual alert time) ← Two-time system
├── recurrence (one-time, daily, weekly)
├── is_completed
└── timestamps
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

**1. Two-Time Notification System**
- `event_time`: What users see on reminder cards (e.g., "3:00 PM")
- `notification_time`: When alert fires (e.g., "2:30 PM" for 30min advance)
- Solves UX problem: users think in event times, need advance warnings

**2. User ID Architecture** 
- `users.user_id` stores copy of Supabase `auth.users.id`
- All foreign keys reference `user_id` (not `users.id`)
- Enables RLS policies to filter by `auth.uid()::text`
- Critical for proper multi-user data isolation

**3. Local Notification Architecture**
- Device-local scheduling (no push notification server needed)
- Automatic rescheduling on app startup
- Handles device restarts, app reinstalls, updates
- Compares database state vs scheduled notifications

**4. Row Level Security Implementation**
Four policies per table (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE):
```sql
-- Example: SELECT policy on reminders table
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own reminders"
ON reminders FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid()::text = user_id);
```

## 🚀 Development Journey

### Timeline: Concept → TestFlight (6 weeks)

| Milestone | Achievement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Initial Build** | Successfully navigated 14+ failed build attempts |
| **Build 2** | First functional TestFlight build after nuclear reset |
| **Build 4** | Fixed authentication loop and notification persistence |
| **Build 5** | Resolved critical cross-user data leak via RLS |

### Major Technical Challenges Solved

#### 🔴 Challenge 1: Cross-User Data Leak (Build 5)
**Problem:** Users could see other users' reminders in production.

**Root Cause:** Overly permissive RLS policy with `using_expression = true` combined with PERMISSIVE mode created OR logic that bypassed restrictive policies.

**Solution:** 
- Identified testing policy left in production
- Deleted "Allow all operations for testing" policy
- Verified four proper RLS policies remain (all filtering by `auth.uid()`)
- Confirmed zero cross-contamination across 19 test reminders

**Learning:** PERMISSIVE policies combine with OR logic—one bad policy overrides all good ones.

#### 🔴 Challenge 2: Authentication Loop (Build 4)
**Problem:** Infinite navigation loop between Welcome and Dashboard screens.

**Root Cause:** Race condition between AsyncStorage session restore and `onAuthStateChange` listener registration.

**Solution:**
- Session restore MUST complete before listener registration
- Single source of truth: `onAuthStateChange` as primary auth signal
- Module-level `isCheckingAuth` guard with try/finally pattern
- Removed duplicate `checkAuthAndOnboarding` calls

**Learning:** `useRef` and module-level guards fail during hot reload—architectural fix needed, not flag-based.

#### 🔴 Challenge 3: 14+ Failed Builds (Build 2 Breakthrough)
**Problem:** Persistent build failures, pod install hanging, npm permission errors.

**Solution - Nuclear Reset Process:**
1. Complete deletion: `rm -rf ios node_modules package-lock.json`
2. Clean npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
3. Mac restart (resolved system-level hanging)
4. Fresh install: `npm install --cache .npm-cache`
5. Clean prebuild: `npx expo prebuild --platform ios --clean`
6. Always open `.xcworkspace` (not `.xcodeproj`)

**Learning:** System-level issues (not just command issues) can cause cascading failures. Mac restart + nuclear reset = reliable recovery pattern.

#### 🔴 Challenge 4: Notification Persistence
**Problem:** Notifications disappeared after app reinstall/device restart.

**Solution:** Implemented automatic rescheduling on app startup:
```javascript
// Compare database reminders vs scheduled notifications
const scheduled = await Notifications.getAllScheduledNotificationsAsync();
const activeReminders = await getActiveReminders();
// Reschedule missing notifications
```

**Learning:** Local notifications are device-local—they don't survive reinstalls. Rescheduling on startup is required architecture, not a bug fix.

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. React Native + Expo
- **.xcworkspace vs .xcodeproj:** Must open workspace when using CocoaPods
- **Build numbers:** Must be in `app.json` under `ios.buildNumber` (prebuild overwrites Info.plist)
- **iOS Simulator:** Best for daily dev (Expo Go has SDK version constraints)

### 2. Database & Security
- **RLS Policy Logic:** PERMISSIVE mode uses OR—one bad policy breaks everything
- **Foreign Key Design:** `users.user_id` (auth UID copy) vs `users.id` (random UUID)
- **Testing Multi-User:** Always test with multiple accounts to verify isolation

### 3. Notification Architecture
- **Local Notifications:** Don't survive app reinstalls, require rescheduling
- **Two-Time System:** Display time ≠ notification time for UX clarity
- **Startup Rescheduling:** Compare database vs scheduled notifications on app launch

### 4. AI Integration
- **Token Management:** Claude Haiku 3.5 more cost-effective than GPT-4 for parsing
- **Voice UX:** Press-and-hold prevents cutting users off mid-sentence
- **Context-Aware Timing:** Different reminder types need different advance notice

### 5. Debugging Methodology
- **Nuclear Reset:** Delete ios/ + node_modules + package-lock.json when stuck
- **System Restarts:** Mac restart can resolve persistent tool failures
- **One Change at a Time:** Test in isolation to identify root cause
- **Database Verification:** Always query `auth.users` table to confirm UID relationships
